# Things you could do
If you want to contribute but do not know where to start, this list provides some starting points.
- Tests might be cool.

## Pull Requests

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it breaks tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `readme.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - The versions are numbered BREAKING.FEATURE.FIX, randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.

**Happy coding**!
